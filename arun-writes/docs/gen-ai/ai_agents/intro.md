# What is an AI Agent?

1. There are lot of definitions for what is an AI agents, but I arrived one definition - an `AI Agent` is something that is good at a specific task.
2. From AI community, some say there are AI Agents, AI Orchestrator, AI Workflow to explain about the AI in loop.
3. Instead of saying all those, we can say in the use case `What is the degree of autonomy needed?` Below explanation from `Andrew Ng` is the right thing to call

![AI Agent Autonomy](../../../src/images/ai_agent_autonomy.jfif)

4. So far I have created agents which are in between `Less-autonomous ` and `Semi-autonomous`.
5. Let's create our first agent and go over different degrees of autonomy.
